# Home-based task delegation (included from MPIExt.jl).
#
# A task spawned with `lend=true` keeps everything the SPMD design derives per rank: its owner, the
# `MPIRef`, the ids and tags, the stubs on other ranks. Only the call of the task's function on the
# owner may be satisfied by another ("idle") rank: the owner ships `(f, args)`, the thief runs it on a
# free thread and ships the value or the exception back, and the owner then goes on exactly as if it
# had run the function itself (status broadcast, result chunk). See LLM_info/DESIGN_NOTE_cross_rank_balancing.md.
#
# Three parts:
#  * `LendPool`: a pure data structure (no MPI). A lendable task takes one of `capacity` slots or
#    waits in a queue; a freed slot goes to the OLDEST queued task, a thief takes the NEWEST. Every
#    transition happens under the pool's lock, so each task is claimed exactly once, by a local slot
#    or by a thief, and a record is filled before it becomes claimable (AGENTS.md lesson 10).
#  * `LendState` + service task: one per rank, on a duplicated communicator that only carries lending
#    traffic (it cannot shift world tags or uniform ids). All sends are non-blocking and are progressed
#    by the service task, so it never waits for a peer that may itself be waiting for it. An idle
#    rank (free slots) keeps a request for as many tasks as it has free slots registered at every other
#    rank (`REQ`); a rank without surplus remembers it (lifeline) and answers when a lendable task is queued.
#  * `mpi_lend_run`: the owner side, called in place of `mpi_execute_inner`.
