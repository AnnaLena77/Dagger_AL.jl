# TileFlow: owner-computes execution of task graphs over whole tiles.  Opt-in and additive; the Datadeps path is untouched.
#
# Every rank walks the same program (the loop nest of the algorithm) and calls `tile_spawn!` for EVERY task, but only does real work for the tasks it
# owns.  Per task each rank updates one tiny replicated table: per tile a version and a bitmask of the ranks that hold the current version.  From
# it every rank derives, without a single message, which transfers happen (sender = lowest holder, receiver = the task's rank, tag = per-pair
# sequence number) and whether it takes part.  Own tasks run as `@light` tasks, so there is no Thunk, Chunk, MemPool, scope or processor per task.
#
# A task is `tile_spawn!(space, f, TileIn(id), TileRW(id)...)`.  It runs on the rank of its first `TileRW` tile (or `at=`); `f` receives the tile
# arrays in argument order and modifies the `TileRW` ones in place.  Tiles are whole objects: no views or sub-ranges (use Datadeps for those), no
# tasks created inside tasks.  See AGENTS.md lessons 138-139 for why tiles are created by many threads and received into pooled buffers.
#
# Transports (`TileTransport`) carry the arrays: `LocalTileTransport` (one process, nothing to send) is the default; MPIExt provides one for MPI.
