export LightTask, @light

# Light tasks: an opt-in fast path for fine-grained shared-memory work.  A light task is one small mutable object (function, arguments,
# result, atomic count of unfinished dependencies, lock-free stack of dependents) handed to Julia's own scheduler once its dependencies are
# done.  There is no Thunk, Chunk, MemPool, scope or processor in between, so it also has none of their features: no scopes or options,
# no Datadeps, no MPI/Distributed placement (a light task runs in the process that created it), no cancellation, no logging events.
# Arguments may be values, other `LightTask`s (dependencies) or `DTask`s (dependencies; a failed DTask fails the light task).
# `light_to_dtask(l)` waits for the light task and gives a DTask of its value (the other direction).
#
# Protocol (see AGENTS.md lesson 136): `left` starts at 1 (a guard) + one per dependency, BEFORE anything is registered; a refused
# registration (dependency already done) subtracts again; the guard is dropped last.  Only the thread that brings `left` to zero launches the
# task, exactly once.

The caller waits (cooperatively) until `l` is done before the DTask is created: a DTask that
blocked on `l` would occupy a processor while `l`'s own dependencies need that processor's
thread, and Dagger's occupancy wait spins on `yield()` (AGENTS.md lesson 12), which deadlocks
on one or two threads. Not usable under MPI/Distributed.
