# ONE processor does, so a vector of exact scopes pins each worker to its own thread, e.g. to keep the loop off thread 1.

"""
    dynamic_for_async(f, n::Integer, args...; chunk=nothing, workers=Threads.nthreads(), scope=nothing) -> Vector{DTask}

Start `f(i, args...)` for every `i` in `1:n` as `workers` self-scheduling tasks and return them.
The result of each task is the number of indices that worker took, so `fetch.(tasks)` shows how
the loop was balanced (the entries add up to `n`).
`args` are ordinary task arguments: a `DTask` or a `Chunk` among them is waited for and
resolved before any worker starts, exactly as for `Dagger.@spawn`, so the loop starts when
its inputs exist and the caller need not wait for them (`f(i)` when there are none).
Each worker takes the next `chunk` indices from a shared atomic counter until none are
left, so the scheduler is entered `workers` times, however many chunks there are; with a
task per chunk, a loop of cheap iterations is dominated by the cost of a task (about
100 us). `chunk` defaults to `cld(n, 4workers)`. Workers that find the counter exhausted
return at once, so asking for more workers than free threads is harmless.

All workers must run in one process (they share the counter): the default scope is the
current worker's processors; under MPI pass a scope inside one rank, e.g.
`scope=Dagger.scope(mpi_rank=r)`. `scope` may also be a vector with one scope per worker (see `_worker_scope`): a scope naming one
processor binds its worker to that thread under MPI, a scope over several threads does not. `f` must be safe to call from several threads at
once; the order of iterations is unspecified.

Reduce `f(i, args...)` over `i in 1:n` with `op`, on `workers` self-scheduling tasks like
[`dynamic_for_async`](@ref); returns a `DTask` whose value is the result. **The combination order is fixed**: the
indices are cut into chunks of `chunk` (default `cld(n, 64)`, independent of `workers`), each chunk is folded in index
order, and the chunk results are folded in chunk order starting from `init`. So the result does not depend on which
worker took which chunk, on the number of workers, or on timing: a floating-point sum is bitwise the same on every
run (and on every rank that computes it). It does depend on `chunk`, as any reduction tree does: keep it fixed
when states are compared byte for byte. `op` must be associative in the sense that the result is acceptable (it is
not required to be commutative); `n == 0` returns `init` (an `ArgumentError` without one). `f` must be thread-safe.
